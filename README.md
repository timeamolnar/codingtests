**FizzBuzzBasic :**
Write some code that prints out the following for a contiguous range of numbers:

* the number
* 'fizz' for numbers that are multiples of 3
* 'buzz' for numbers that are multiples of 5
* 'fizzbuzz' for numbers that are multiples of 15

e.g. if I run the program over a range from 1-20 I should get the following output:


```
#!console

1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz

```

**RomanNumeralToInteger :**

- convert Roman Numeral to Integer use TDD


Create a function taking a positive integer as its parameter and returning a string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer.

Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately, starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.

In Roman numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 

2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII. 

1666 uses each Roman symbol in descending order: MDCLXVI.
