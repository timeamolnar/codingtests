**FizzBuzzBasic :**
Write some code that prints out the following for a contiguous range of numbers:

* the number
* 'fizz' for numbers that are multiples of 3
* 'buzz' for numbers that are multiples of 5

e.g. if I run the program over a range from 1-20 I should get the following output:


```
#!console

1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz
